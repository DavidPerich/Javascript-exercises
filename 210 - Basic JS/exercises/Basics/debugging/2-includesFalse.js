// Caroline has written a very simple function, includesFalse, that searches a list of primitives for the boolean false. If false is found, the function immediately returns true. If no occurrence of false has been found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns false.

// Caroline's last method invocation of includesFalse (line 18) doesn't return what she expects. Why is that? Fix the code so that it behaves as intended.

function includesFalse(list) {
  var i;
  var element;

  for (i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    element = list[i];

    if (element === false) {  // had to change this to strict equality. When comparing with loose equality if the values are not of the same type then one gets cooerced. in this case I think 0 gets coerced to be false since it is a falsey value.
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}

includesFalse([8, null, 'abc', true, 'launch', 11, false]);       // true
includesFalse(['programming', undefined, 37, 64, true, 'false']); // false
includesFalse([9422, 'lambda', true, 0, '54', null]);             // true
