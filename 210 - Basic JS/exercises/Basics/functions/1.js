// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code until after you have tried to answer.

var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);

// JavaScript uses lexical scope. This means that it determines the scope of a variable by the structure of the program. This program declares a variable named myVar in two places. The first is outside of any function, giving the first myVar a global scope. The second place is inside of someFunction. Functions in JavaScript create a new scope â€” a scope that is "local" to the function. This local scope is also referred to as an "inner" scope in relation to the global "outer" scope.
